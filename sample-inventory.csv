# This is how the inventory file looks like:
# Each line contains:
#
#      TYPE,QUANTITY
#
# where the type works like this:
#
#   M1 = Mining Probe G1
#   M2 = Mining Probe G2
#   ...
#   R1 = Research Probe G1
#   R2 = Research Probe G2
#   ...
#   B1 = Booster Probe G1
#   S = Storage Probe
#   D = Duplicator Probe
#   B = Basic Probe
#
# Note: you don't need to specify Basic Probes, the program assumes you have an
# infinite amount of them.
#
# Note: If you have more than enough probes for the entire map, it's a good idea
# to leave some probes out of the inventory. In this example, I commented out
# the M1, M2 and M3 probes, since I have more than enough of the better mining probes
# for the entire map. Less probes means less computation.
