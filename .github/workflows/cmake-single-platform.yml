# The peculiarity of this workflow is that runs `vcpkg install` at `run-vcpkg`,
# rather than with `run-cmake.
# Also, it does not assume that vcpkg is a submodule of this repository.
#
# The workflow does the following:
# - Download and setup vcpkg (which is stored NOT in a Git submodule), then run
#   `vcpkg install` to install the packages described in vcpkg.json manifest file.
# - Note: at this point, all the vcpkg dependencies specified in vcpkg.json are installed,
#   and it is possible to run anything that is needed to build the C++ application as.
#   long the paths to headers and libraries are correctly set.
#
# - _Warning:_ in this sample, CMake is going to be used to build the application,
#   but anything else could be used. This means that vcpkg will be run again and
#   it will quickly realize that all dependencies are already installed.
#   In short: *it is not needed to run vcpkg* in the step before if you build with CMake,
#   since CMake will run it for you already!
#   Look to (hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod.yml)[./hosted-ninja-vcpkg_submod.yml] sample.
#
# - Finally, it runs CMake with CMakePreset.json and vcpkg's toolchain file to build
#   the C++ sources with Ninja.
